	abstract = {Fault tolerance is becoming increasingly important for upcoming exascale systems, supporting distributed data processing, due to the expected decrease in the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). To ensure the availability, reliability, dependability, and performance of the system, addressing the fault tolerance challenge is crucial. It aims to keep the distributed system running at a reduced capacity while avoiding complete data loss, even in the presence of faults, with minimal impact on system performance. This comprehensive survey aims to provide a detailed understanding of the importance of fault tolerance in distributed systems, including a classification of faults, errors, failures, and fault-tolerant techniques (reactive, proactive, and predictive). We collected a corpus of 490 papers published from 2014 to 2023 by searching in Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and ACM digital library databases. After a systematic review, 17 reactive models, 17 proactive models, and 14 predictive models were shortlisted and compared. A taxonomy of ideas behind the proposed models was also created for each of these categories of fault-tolerant solutions. Additionally, it examines how fault tolerance capability is incorporated into popular big data processing tools such as Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Flink. Finally, promising future research directions in this domain are discussed.},

	abstract = {Many real-world applications employ web service frameworks to provide application programming interface (API) services to businesses and end-consumers, following a clientserver architecture. Service providers typically run a web server to deliver services to consumers. Here, service providers and consumers often belong to different organisations in applications such as supply chain management and logistics. In multistakeholder safety-critical and mission-critical applications, the centralised web server delivers services by executing computations upon receiving consumers’ API requests. Such computations may fail due to crash or byzantine failures. The former happens because of hardware or infrastructure faults, while the latter happens because of a malicious actor. Note that the organisation that runs the web server may act dishonestly by running computations incorrectly for ﬁnancial beneﬁts, or an external attacker may compromise the web server without the knowledge of the infrastructure owner. As a result of these failures, the centralised web server is susceptible to single-point-of-failure issues. The organisation that runs the web server must be blindly trusted and does not provide transparency and auditability to its clients. We propose DeWS, a Decentralised and Byzantine Fault-tolerant Web Service framework, which overcomes these single-pointof-failure issues while delivering transparency and auditability through a blockchain-based ledger. The proof-of-concept implementation of DeWS using the Tendermint blockchain platform shows that our framework can tolerate byzantine failures at the cost of high latency. DeWS is the ﬁrst Byzantine Fault-tolerant web service framework. It can support a shift towards more decentralised web services to provide safety assurances for safetycritical and mission-critical applications.},

	abstract = {Blockchain promises to make online services more fault tolerant due to their inherent distributed nature. Their ability to execute arbitrary programs in different geo-distributed regions and on diverse operating systems make them an alternative of choice to our dependence on unique software whose recent failure affected 8.5 millions of machines. As of today, it remains, however, unclear whether blockchains can truly tolerate failures. In this paper, we assess the fault tolerance of blockchain. To this end, we inject failures in controlled deployments of five modern blockchain systems, namely Algorand, Aptos, Avalanche, Redbelly and Solana. We introduce a novel sensitivity metric, interesting in its own right, as the difference between the integrals of two cumulative distribution functions, one obtained in a baseline environment and one obtained in an adversarial environment. Our results indicate that (i) all blockchains except Redbelly are highly impacted by the failure of a small part of their network, (ii) Avalanche and Redbelly benefit from the redundant information needed for Byzantine fault tolerance while others are hampered by it, and more dramatically (iii) Avalanche and Solana cannot recover from localised transient failures.},

	abstract = {The sharing economy is centralizing services, leading to misuses of the Internet. We can list growing damages of data hacks, global outages and even the use of data to manipulate their owners. Unfortunately, there is no decentralized web where users can interact peer-to-peer in a secure way. Blockchains incentivize participants to individually validate every transaction and impose their block to the network. As a result, the validation of smart contract requests is computationally intensive while the agreement on a unique state does not make full use of the network. In this paper, we propose Collachain, a new byzantine fault tolerant blockchain compatible with the largest ecosystem of DApps that leverages collaboration. First, the pariticipants executing smart contracts collaborate to validate the transactions, hence halving the number of validations required by modern blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Libra). Second, the participants in the consensus collaborate to combine their block proposal into a superblock, hence improving throughput as the system grows to hundreds of nodes. In addition, Collachain offers the possibility to its users to interact securely with each other without downloading the blockchain, hence allowing interactions via mobile devices. Collachain is effective at outperforming the Concord and Quorum blockchains and its throughput peaks at 4500 TPS under a Twitter DApp (Decentralized Application) workload. Finally, we demonstrate Collachain's scalability by deploying it on 200 nodes located in 10 countries over 5 continents.},

	abstract = {Distributed applications composed of collections of Web services may call for diverse levels of reliability in different parts of the system. Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is a general strategy that has recently been shown to be practical for the development of certain classes of survivable, client-server, distributed applications; however, little research has been done on incorporating it into selective parts of multi-tier, distributed applications like Web services that have heterogeneous reliability requirements. To understand the impacts of combining BFT and Web services, we have created Thema, a new BFT middleware system that extends the BFT and Web services technologies to provide a structured way to build Byzantine-fault-tolerant, survivable Web services that application developers can use like other Web services. From a reliability perspective, our enhancements are also novel in that they allow Byzantine-fault-tolerant services: (1) to support the multi-tiered requirements of Web services, and (2) to provide standardized Web services support for their own clients (through WSDL interfaces and SOAP communication). In this paper we study key architectural implications of combining BFT with Web services and provide a performance evaluation of Thema using the TPC-W benchmark.},

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a framework, called BFT-WS. BFT-WS is designed to operate on top of the standard SOAP messaging framework for maximum interoperability. It is implemented as a pluggable module within the Axis2 architecture, as such, it requires minimum changes to the Web applications. The core fault tolerance mechanisms used in BFT-WS are based on the well-known Castro and Liskov's BFT algorithm for optimal efficiency. Our performance measurements confirm that BFT-WS incurs only moderate runtime overhead considering the complexity of the mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Our growing reliance on online services accessible on the Internet demands highly available systems that provide correct service without interruptions. Software bugs, operator mistakes, and malicious attacks are a major cause of service interruptions and they can cause arbitrary behavior, that is, Byzantine faults. This article describes a new replication algorithm, BFT, that can be used to build highly available systems that tolerate Byzantine faults. BFT can be used in practice to implement real services: it performs well, it is safe in asynchronous environments such as the Internet, it incorporates mechanisms to defend against Byzantine-faulty clients, and it recovers replicas proactively. The recovery mechanism allows the algorithm to tolerate any number of faults over the lifetime of the system provided fewer than 1/3 of the replicas become faulty within a small window of vulnerability. BFT has been implemented as a generic program library with a simple interface. We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages. The performance results show that BFS performs 2\% faster to 24\% slower than production implementations of the NFS protocol that are not replicated. This supports our claim that the BFT library can be used to build practical systems that tolerate Byzantine faults.},

	abstract = {Blockchain systems have seen much growth in recent years due to the immense potential attributed to the technology behind these systems. However, this popularity has outlined a critical scalability issue that most blockchain systems are now confronted with. With their increasing popularity comes an increasing amount of load on the system. Several scaling solutions that modify either the functioning of the underlying protocol or that build on top of them have already been proposed; however, each of these solutions comes with their advantages and disadvantages. This paper aims to survey the current state-of-the-art of rollups as a scaling solution. We discuss the mode of operation of the different types of rollups, outline state-of-the-art implementations of each type together with their features and limitations. We also conduct a performance analysis comparing these implementations. Finally, we outline avenues for future research around rollups as a scaling solution.},

This implementation is used as the core for building State Machine Replication (SMR) platforms with Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) guarantees. A noteworthy deployment of Tendermint has been in continuous operation since 2019 within a blockchain called Cosmos Hub. The Cosmos Hub supports the development of decentralized applications, and stands as one of the largest and most stable ongoing deployments of a BFT SMR platform.While successful in practice, the Tendermint consensus protocol has no definitive description in the literature. It is not clear what makes this protocol unique or how it fits into a blockchain protocol stack. In this short paper, we revisit Tendermint. We contrast Tendermint with other major consensus algorithms, examining its unique design choices. We also focus on the requirements which dictated Tendermint’s design. Lastly, we briefly analyze the accountability support which Tendermint provides.},

Blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability, and security, is showing promise for easing some global supply chain management problems. In this paper, blockchain technology and smart contracts are critically examined with potential application to supply chain management. Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management.},

We introduce a time-probabilistic failure model of distributed systems that employ the service-oriented paradigm for deﬁning cooperation with clients over the Internet and clouds. The trade-offs between consistency, availability and latency are examined, as well as the role of the application timeout as the main determinant in the interplay between system availability and responsiveness. The model introduced heavily relies on collecting and analysing a large amount of data representing the probabilistic behaviour of such systems. The paper presents experimental results of measuring the response time in a distributed service-oriented system whose replicas are deployed at different Amazon EC2 location domains. These results clearly show that improvements in system consistency increase system latency, which is in line with the qualitative implication of the well-known CAP theorem. The paper proposes a set of novel mathematical models that are based on statistical analysis of collected data and enable quantiﬁed response time prediction depending on the timeout setup and on the level of consistency provided by the replicated system.},

In the present article, we fill this gap by proposing the first comprehensive, large-scale web session security measurement based on post-login data. Our analysis is comprehensive in that it deals with all key aspects of web sessions, i.e., the login process, the logout process and the authentication cookie handling. Our automated approach analysed an extensive set of session management practices of over 6,000 sites where login was successful and authentication cookies could be automatically detected, uncovering a widespread adoption of insecure practices in the wild.},

	abstract = {Scalability is one of the trilemma of blockchain technology that hinders its adoption for large-scale decentralized applications (dApps). Researchers have proposed several layer-1 and layer-2 solutions to address the issue. This paper focuses on layer-2 solutions or protocols operating on top of the primary blockchain to enhance scalability. Previous works surveying these solutions mainly focused on a particular layer-2 solution, like rollup, or a specific application, such as smart manufacturing. However, in this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of layer-2 scalability solutions, such as state channels, side-chain, and rollup, from the perspectives of various functional requirements of block chain applications. More precisely, the goal is to evaluate the applicability of the layer-2 scalability solutions in terms of the application patterns that depict the transactional dependencies, interoperability, decentralization, and security. To further illustrate these features, the paper evaluates the applicability of the layer-2 solutions on the case studies of major blockchain applications, including supply chain management and healthcare. Our analysis suggests that in terms of throughput, application pattern is the most crucial aspect in selecting the scaling solutions, in conjecture with other features as per the application demand.},
